## Replace Cartoon Avatar with Realistic AI-Generated Photo

### What's changing

Generate a realistic AI photo of a woman (beauty salon customer look) and replace the current cartoon avatar in `src/assets/avatar-sandra.webp`.

### Steps

1. **Generate image** using the AI image model with a prompt like: "Professional headshot photo of a young Latina woman smiling warmly, natural makeup, soft lighting, neutral background, portrait style, realistic photography"
2. **Save** the generated image to `src/assets/avatar-sandra.webp` (overwriting the cartoon)
3. No code changes needed — the import already points to this file
