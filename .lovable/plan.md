## Move Set Hibrido Image Up a Bit More

The current position at `center 50%` is close but needs a little more adjustment upward.

### Change

**File: `src/pages/Quiz.tsx`, line 18**

Change `imagePosition` for Set Hibrido from `"center 50%"` to `"center 58%"`. This nudges the visible crop area up a bit more so the eye and lashes sit higher in the tile, fully clear of the gradient.
