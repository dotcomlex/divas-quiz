## Move Set Hibrido Image Up Further

The eye is still partially hidden behind the gradient. Since this is your most popular service, it needs to look perfect.

### Change

**File: `src/pages/Quiz.tsx`, line 18**

Update `imagePosition` for Set Hibrido from `"center 35%"` to `"center 25%"`. This is a more aggressive shift upward to ensure the full eye and lash line sit well above the gradient fade area. Going from 35% to 25% should give enough clearance.
